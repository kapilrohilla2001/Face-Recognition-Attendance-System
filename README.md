# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
This project identifies a real-time face recognition-based attendance system along with computer vision and Firebase for backend solutions. This captures live video feed from a webcam, recognizes the faces of the people in the frame, matches them with the face encoding saved in the database and records the attendance.
